The government proposed a law several years ago to criminalize unlicensed weapons and carrying arms in public, but it was rejected by both controlling and opposition parties in parliament. The most important markets for weapons are in Sa\u2019ada province, where the notorious gun dealer Saleh Ahmed is blamed for supplying the al Houthi rebels and exporting guns to Saudi Arabia.

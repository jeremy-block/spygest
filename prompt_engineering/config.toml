# P3: "This session focused primarily on guns. Many search events were repeated, and some were nonsensical. It is possible they struggled to use the tool. They focused mainly on the people and events in the middle east. The most common country they returned to was Dubai. This session was an hour and 23 minutes long, and most documents received less than 1 minute of attention. They flipped through many topics quickly at the beginning of their session before they slowed down around the first-hour mark. They indeed came across many characters, but it is hard to determine who was followed most diligently. It appears like Mikhail Dombrovski and Saleh Ahmed were most frequently inspected. They ultimately ran 45 searches, less than average for this sensemaking task (57.25 searches)."

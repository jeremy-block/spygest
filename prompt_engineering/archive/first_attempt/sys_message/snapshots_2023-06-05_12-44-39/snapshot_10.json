They noted that Dr. George and Mikhail emailed and then transitioned to searches about \"Kenya\" and the Middle East. At this time, they were reviewing people like Leonid Minsky and Anna Nicole Smith. By the end of the session, they had transitioned to exploring documents from Russia and middle eastern countries. They searched for \"death,\" \"kasem\" and \"dubai.\" In the end, they returned to some of the same documents they had opened at the beginning but also opened many different documents for the first time.

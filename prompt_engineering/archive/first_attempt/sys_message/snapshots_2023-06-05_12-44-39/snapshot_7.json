When you are summarizing a segment, make sure you take into account summaries of previous segments. Please summarize a segment in at most 100 words. The goal is to communicate findings and progress in a collaborative investigation scenario. Here's an EXAMPLE (delimited by triple backticks) of the summarization for an overall interaction session. EXAMPLE: ```This session began by searching for the word \"Nigeria\" and looking at the documents returned. They noted that Dr. George and Mikhail emailed and then transitioned to searches about \"Kenya\" and the Middle East. At this time, they were reviewing people like Leonid Minsky and Anna Nicole Smith. By the end of the session, they had transitioned to exploring documents from Russia and middle eastern countries. They searched for \"death,\" \"kasem\" and \"dubai.\" In the end, they returned to some of the same documents they had opened at the beginning but also opened many different documents for the first time. Out of the 46 topics and 102 documents, they reviewed 39 topics, opened 45% of the total documents at least once, and spent an average of 30 seconds with each document. The people they returned to most frequently were Leonid Minsky, Mikhail Dombrovski, and Dr. George.```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the sentences describing the interactions of segment 1 delimited by triple backticks in at most 100 words.

    "contents": "Report Date:  10 March 2009  from the New York Times <br><br>  The scene in Leonid Minsky\u2019s hotel room on the night of February 1, 2009 could have been taken from a classic cult film: Minsky, middle-aged, pale and fat and dressed in a colorful silk robe, flanked by a quartet of Russian and Italian prostitutes. A pornographic film flickers in the background. Minsky, who is the registered owner of the Galleria Hotel in Soncino, a small town outside Milan, Italy, has transformed his two-room suite into an office, a party hall, and a hangout of shady European businessman.  Then, without warning, the police arrive at Room 341, putting an end to the party and apparently derailing the career of a prominent international gun smuggler.  It would be permanently derailed when Minsky was reportedly shot to death in his jail cell by a guard two days later.  Details of this event are sketchy. Although local police supposedly raided Minsky\u2019s hotel on a tip from an unpaid prostitute, the Times has acquired a report that shows the Rome customs police had had Minsky under surveillance since 1992 while investigating an international criminal organization involved in laundering international drug money through the foreign bank accounts of Italian businessmen. The report also says that in 1997 Italian intelligence services conducted a complex investigation on a criminal group of Ukrainian origins associated involved in international arms and drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion and other offenses. A key leader in this organization is Minsky. That hot August evening in Soncino, police found $500,000 worth of uncut diamonds. Later analysis found most came from Russia -- no African origins could be confirmed despite the diamond scales later found in Minsky\u2019s Lagos office. They found receipts for diamond and gun shipments to Yemen. They found a duffel bag filled with more than $35,000 in American, Italian, Hungarian and Mauritian currency. From a briefcase and piles scattered around the rooms, police collected 1,500 documents -- in Russian, Ukrainian, French, German, Dutch, English and Italian -- relating to Minsky\u2019s wide variety of business operations. Specific findings included documents on his dealings in oil, timber and consumer goods; maps of the Kenya-Sudan border; an inquiry by Minsky concerning Nigerian civil engineering and bridge construction services; an offer from Minsky\u2019s Korean representative asking him to ascertain whether Liberian President Charles Taylor would be interested in establishing diplomatic relations with Pyongyang; and a record of a $30,333.23 payment to Anna Nicole Smith as \u201ca thank you and an apology.\u201d Most important, however, police found evidence of several proposed and realized arms deals. Leonid Minsky was part of a new generation of highly organized post-Soviet criminals whose power and success is largely attributable to the climate of chaos, poverty and disintegrating state apparatus that governs many former Soviet republics today. Mobsters have easy access to former Soviet Army stockpiles -- now considered surplus small arms -- favored by embargoed military groupings seeking cheap weaponry wherever they can get it. ",

    "contents": " Report Date:  23 November 2008  from SABA, Yemen News Agency <br><br> San\u2019a\u2019 -- Fighting in northern Yemen has moved into Saudi Arabia, forcing school closures and sending thousands fleeing, according to the United Nations. Fighting has now spilled into Saudi Arabia, reportedly causing 240 villages to be evacuated and more than 50 schools to be closed,  Sigrid Khan of UNICEF said in a statement this week. The total number of people displaced by the conflict since 2004 has gone up to more than 175,000, from an estimated 150,000 only a few weeks ago. Some point fingers at destabilizing foreign influence in the regional affair, directed against the Saudi regime.  Yet, others insist that this is a problem rooted in domestic unrest. The conflict is considered to be both separatist -- over who will assert authority in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shiite Islam will dominate in majority Sunni Yemen. The rebels are supporters of slain Shiite cleric Hussein al-Houthi. Al-Houthi founded a new movement called the Sha\u2018ab al-Muminin (the Young Believers) and acquired significant religious status amongst the Za\u2019idi population of northern Yemen.  But as the fighting escalates, the situation is worsening for children, Kahn said. During the past three months, children affected by the conflict in the north have seen all their basic rights violated. Lack of safe water, nutrition and hygiene is exerting a heavy toll on their health and well-being, and threatening their very survival, Khan said.  Camps for refugees are filled, and those who cannot obtain a place in the camps are collecting just outside. Yemen's official news agency SABA reported Friday it was working to establish new refugees camps, however, this will do little to solve the core problems. ",

Al-Kalid was quoted by the state-run TruthToday.net as warning that the Ministry would be all over all who sell secretly or in public any pieces of weapons. The Ministry will never allow the death trade to appear again after we took an unprecedented step to eliminate this distressing way to make money through death, he added Yemen's efforts at internal control started after 9/11 with the new international focus on terrorism. The Yemeni government embarked upon a widely known weapons buyback program, hoping to neutralize the threat they posed to government control, in a non-confrontational manner. Yemeni authorities have shut down all arms businesses in anticipation of the introduction of a new licensing system in a bid to control the trade in a country with one of the highest rates of private gun ownership in the world. The Interior Ministry will take on the task of regulating weapons purchases in the country through the official licensing and monitoring of dealers and dealerships. Yemen has an estimated 60 million firearms in private hands, roughly three for every man, woman and child. Gun ownership has long been seen as an essential part of Yemeni culture. ",

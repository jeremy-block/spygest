The decision, however, has raised concerns that the greater availability of weapons could lead to an increase in violent incidents among ordinary Saudis.  Arms smuggling is on the rise in the kingdom, especially in the south where it is a big business for Yemeni arms dealers who smuggle the arms into neighboring Saudi, where many of them are sold to al Qa\u2019eda and other anti-government militants.  In the southern Jazan and Assir provinces, carrying a firearm is part of the local culture and many people there do not have permits for their firearms.  Last month, a unit of Saudi National Guards known as the Mujahidin issued a statement saying it had seized a large shipment of weapons \u2013 which included hand grenades, explosives, guns and ammunition \u2013 in Dafa valley when it intercepted arms smugglers led by a notorious arms merchant Saleh Ahmed, who fled back to Yemen.  <br>In Saudi, there is a 1,000 Saudi riyal fine for anyone who carries licensed arms in public places. A Mr. Haik Hosain recently incurred a punishment of eight months in jail and a 6,000 Saudi riyal fine for possessing an unlicensed firearm.  He was suspected of arms dealing in Saudi, but was not charged. More serious violations, such as using unlicensed firearms, can result in a prison sentence of up to 30 years and a fine of up to 300,000 Saudi riyals.",

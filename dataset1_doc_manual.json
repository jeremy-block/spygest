They noted that Dr. George and Mikhail emailed and then transitioned to searches about \"Kenya\" and the Middle East. At this time, they were reviewing people like Leonid Minsky and Anna Nicole Smith. By the end of the session, they had transitioned to exploring documents from Russia and middle eastern countries. They searched for \"death,\" \"kasem\" and \"dubai.\" In the end, they returned to some of the same documents they had opened at the beginning but also opened many different documents for the first time. Out of the 46 topics and 102 documents, they reviewed 39 topics, opened 45% of the total documents at least once, and spent an average of 30 seconds with each document. The people they returned to most frequently were Leonid Minsky, Mikhail Dombrovski, and Dr. George."

      "summary": "This user focused on activities in the Middle East. They did minimal searching (25 events) and used more of a breadth-based approach to reading more than half of the available documents (53%). In the first half hour, they spent more time reading documents and noted that oil from Nigeria could be a codeword for arms or that someone sold Nigerian weapons. Generally, their search terms were specific country names, but the documents they reviewed included characters of interest, such as Leonid Minsky, Nicolai, and Salih Ahmed. They spent more time understanding the behaviors of Seleh Ahmed and realized that their close ally, Baltasar, was using the code name \"Professor.\" They returned to Sickness in the final 5 minutes, but it does not appear they made any clear conclusions from their analysis."

      "summary": "This session focused primarily on guns. Many search events were repeated, and some were nonsensical. It is possible they struggled to use the tool. They focused mainly on the people and events in the middle east. The most common country they returned to was Dubai. This session was an hour and 23 minutes long, and most documents received less than 1 minute of attention. They flipped through many topics quickly at the beginning of their session before they slowed down around the first-hour mark. They indeed came across many characters, but it is hard to determine who was followed most diligently. It appears like Mikhail Dombrovski and Saleh Ahmed were most frequently inspected. They ultimately ran 45 searches, less than average for this sensemaking task (57.25 searches)."

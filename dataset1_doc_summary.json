Tolah \"John\" Raleigh, 51, of Vienna, Va., entered the guilty plea on behalf of his company, Sampan Enterprises Ltd., at a hearing Thursday in U.S. District Court, admitting that his company sought to broker arms deals without a license. The company was ordered to pay a $15,000 fine, the amount recommended by prosecutors. Raleigh's company was never actually able to sell any equipment, despite several years of effort. According to court records, authorities became suspicious of Raleigh when he returned from a 2007 business trip to Columbia. Raleigh told customs agents that he had been meeting with Yemeni nationals to sell them farm equipment, but a search of his luggage found product brochures for military vehicles and handwritten notes referring to weapons. In fact, Raleigh was trying to sell Swiss-made machine pistols and other military equipment to a contact in Yemen. Court records indicate that contact was Aden as-Sallal, who runs KNA General Trading Company in Sana'a, Yemen. An e-mail to company officials was not immediately returned Thursday. After Thursday's hearing, Raleigh said his Yemeni contacts amounted to \"one businessman who asked some questions about getting some military equipment.\"  Court records suggest that the Yemeni contact may have wanted to establish his own arms distributorship or do business with the Yemeni government. In one e-mail, Raleigh says his Yemeni client is looking for several thousand Glock pistols to outfit the Yemeni presidential guard.",

Fighting has now spilled into Saudi Arabia, reportedly causing 240 villages to be evacuated and more than 50 schools to be closed,  Sigrid Khan of UNICEF said in a statement this week. The total number of people displaced by the conflict since 2004 has gone up to more than 175,000, from an estimated 150,000 only a few weeks ago. Some point fingers at destabilizing foreign influence in the regional affair, directed against the Saudi regime.  Yet, others insist that this is a problem rooted in domestic unrest. The conflict is considered to be both separatist -- over who will assert authority in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shiite Islam will dominate in majority Sunni Yemen. The rebels are supporters of slain Shiite cleric Hussein al-Houthi. Al-Houthi founded a new movement called the Sha\u2018ab al-Muminin (the Young Believers) and acquired significant religious status amongst the Za\u2019idi population of northern Yemen.  But as the fighting escalates, the situation is worsening for children, Kahn said. During the past three months, children affected by the conflict in the north have seen all their basic rights violated. Lack of safe water, nutrition and hygiene is exerting a heavy toll on their health and well-being, and threatening their very survival, Khan said.  Camps for refugees are filled, and those who cannot obtain a place in the camps are collecting just outside. Yemen's official news agency SABA reported Friday it was working to establish new refugees camps, however, this will do little to solve the core problems. ",

Al-Kalid was quoted by the state-run TruthToday.net as warning that the Ministry would be all over all who sell secretly or in public any pieces of weapons. The Ministry will never allow the death trade to appear again after we took an unprecedented step to eliminate this distressing way to make money through death, he added Yemen's efforts at internal control started after 9/11 with the new international focus on terrorism. The Yemeni government embarked upon a widely known weapons buyback program, hoping to neutralize the threat they posed to government control, in a non-confrontational manner. Yemeni authorities have shut down all arms businesses in anticipation of the introduction of a new licensing system in a bid to control the trade in a country with one of the highest rates of private gun ownership in the world. The Interior Ministry will take on the task of regulating weapons purchases in the country through the official licensing and monitoring of dealers and dealerships. Yemen has an estimated 60 million firearms in private hands, roughly three for every man, woman and child. Gun ownership has long been seen as an essential part of Yemeni culture. ",

The decision, however, has raised concerns that the greater availability of weapons could lead to an increase in violent incidents among ordinary Saudis.  Arms smuggling is on the rise in the kingdom, especially in the south where it is a big business for Yemeni arms dealers who smuggle the arms into neighboring Saudi, where many of them are sold to al Qa\u2019eda and other anti-government militants.  In the southern Jazan and Assir provinces, carrying a firearm is part of the local culture and many people there do not have permits for their firearms.  Last month, a unit of Saudi National Guards known as the Mujahidin issued a statement saying it had seized a large shipment of weapons \u2013 which included hand grenades, explosives, guns and ammunition \u2013 in Dafa valley when it intercepted arms smugglers led by a notorious arms merchant Saleh Ahmed, who fled back to Yemen.  <br>In Saudi, there is a 1,000 Saudi riyal fine for anyone who carries licensed arms in public places. A Mr. Haik Hosain recently incurred a punishment of eight months in jail and a 6,000 Saudi riyal fine for possessing an unlicensed firearm.  He was suspected of arms dealing in Saudi, but was not charged. More serious violations, such as using unlicensed firearms, can result in a prison sentence of up to 30 years and a fine of up to 300,000 Saudi riyals.",
        "summary": "The Saudi government has decided to allow the sale of personal firearms in an attempt to reduce the illegal arms trade. However, this decision has raised concerns that the greater availability of weapons could lead to an increase in violent incidents."

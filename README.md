# Spygest Project

This is a repository for the development of a provenance summarization pipeline.
The team will use this repository to share code, the dataset, and more.

## Project Goal

We are building and testing the possibility of generating natural language summaries from interaction histories.
Wether this is generated from a corpus of sentences for every event and summarized or other intermediary steps, we want to understand:

1. Evaluate human preferences
2. feasibility of generating sentences from interaction histories
3. Comparison of features between human generated summaries of interaction histories and the automated approach

### Running Prompt Engineering

We implement a pipeline for conducting experiments using prompt engineering techniques. Please refer to the [README](./prompt_engineering/README.md) in the [`prompt_engineering`](./prompt_engineering/) package
